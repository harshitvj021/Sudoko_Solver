Understanding the Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Objective: Two players, X and O, take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Constraints:

Players alternate turns.

A mark (either X or O) is placed in an empty cell.

The game ends when a player wins or when there are no empty cells left, resulting in a draw.
